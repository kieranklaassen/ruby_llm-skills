Description:
    Creates a new Agent Skill following the agentskills.io specification.
    Skills are stored in app/skills/ and contain a SKILL.md file with
    YAML frontmatter (name, description) and markdown instructions.

Example:
    rails generate skill pdf-report --description "Generate PDF reports"

    This creates:
        app/skills/pdf-report/
        app/skills/pdf-report/SKILL.md

    With optional directories:
        --scripts     Creates scripts/ directory for executable code
        --references  Creates references/ directory for documentation
        --assets      Creates assets/ directory for templates/images

Full Example:
    rails generate skill data-export -d "Export data to CSV/JSON. Use when asked to export or download data." --scripts --assets

    This creates:
        app/skills/data-export/
        app/skills/data-export/SKILL.md
        app/skills/data-export/scripts/.keep
        app/skills/data-export/assets/.keep

Note:
    The description should include both what the skill does AND when to use it.
    Example: "Generate PDF reports from data. Use when asked to create reports or export to PDF."
